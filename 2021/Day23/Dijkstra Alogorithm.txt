Dijkstra's Algorithm:

Single Source Shortest Path :














pre-requiste:
	+ve weights only









Reasoning:

1. if src and destination are same then dist is 0. dist[x][x] is always 0 . that means even though we dont know anything about the distance from Src we we know that 
	
	Dist[Src] = 0 which is its absolute shortest distance. 

	for all other nodes X we have dist[X] = infinity














2. if dist[x] = dx & dis[y] = dy and we discover edge[x][y] = p such that 
	
	dy > dx + p 

	then we can say dist[y] = dx + p . or we can say

    dist[y] = min(dist[y], dist[x] + edge[x][y]) for all nodes x which have an edge to y

   	This can be updated from every node x that we visit











3. We only visit the nodes for which we know we have calculated the absolute shortest path (which will now not be updated).

	from start we know only for src we have absolute shortest path which is Dist[Src] = 0 and it can not be updated since all edges have +ve weight.












4. if in a graph we have 
	some nodes A , B , C for which we have found the absolute shortest paths . 

	And for rest of the nodes D, E, F we have some paths (no path is a path with weight infinity)

	at this point we will say the node in D, E, F which has min dist value has its shortest path found and no other path after this which we might find can be shorter


	proof:


		lets say dist[D] < Dist[E] , Dist[F]  - eq A

		for a smaller path to be introduced to D via E the following will have to be true

		Dist[D] > Dist[E] + W      // W = cumilative weight of a new path from E to D

		but from eq A , this can only be true if W < 0 which is false (under pre-requisites)


		(for E we can still say it is possible that Dist[E] > dist[D] + W where W can be > 0 because Dist[D] < Dist[E] . but not the other way) 


		same for F also



		=> dist[D] now is the absolute shortest path

	so now we say we have 4 nodes A, B, C, D for which we know absolute shortest path 

	E, F are still not completely explored .

	at this point we will visit D and update all the adjecent nodes by point(2) explained above


























algo : 
1.  mark dist[src] = 0
	for all other nodes x dist[x] = inf
	for all nodes x visted[x] = false

2.  while there is any node not vistied : // that is while there exists any node x for which visited[x] == False

		x = the node with min dist[x] amongst the nodes which are not visited
		visited[x] = True

		for all nodes p which are having an edge from x to p and visited[p] is False:
			dist[p] = min(dist[p], dist[x] + adj[x][p])




Q: why dont we use a min heap instead of visited and dist to find min weight edge ??












code:



adj =  [[0, 40, 0, 50, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 30, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 20, 50],
        [0, 0, 10, 0, 40, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 10],
        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]

# we can also show no edge by -1

v = len(adj)
inf = 999999999999999999
dist = [inf]*v
dist[0] = 0
visited = [False]*v



for i in range(v):
    mindist = inf
    x = -1

    for j in range(v):
        if not visited[j] and dist[j] < mindist:
            x = j
            mindist = dist[j]

    visited[x] = True

    for j in range(v):
        if not visited[j] and adj[x][j] > 0:
            dist[j] = min(dist[j], dist[x] + adj[x][j])

print(dist)


output:
[0, 40, 60, 50, 80, 90]
