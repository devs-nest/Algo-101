Bellman Ford Algorithm:

Single src shortest path:

Difference between this and dijkstra's algo is thhat this can support -ve weights assigned to edges. 



Pre-requisites:
	cycles with total path sum as -ve is not allowed


Reasoning:

1. if src and destination are same then dist is 0. dist[x][x] is always 0 . that means even though we dont know anything about the distance from Src we we know that 
	
	Dist[Src] = 0 which is its absolute shortest distance. 

	for all other nodes X we have dist[X] = infinity

2. Relaxation Process:
	
	if dist[x] = dx & dis[y] = dy and we discover edge[x][y] = p such that 
	
	dy > dx + p 

	then we can say dist[y] = dx + p . or we can say

    dist[y] = min(dist[y], dist[x] + edge[x][y]) for all nodes x which have an edge to y


3. if we relax all edges and there is a change in some vertice's distance then that change can trigger other changes and we have to redo relaxation for all the nodes again.
if distance does not change we can be certain that this is the shortest path for all nodes.

4. Max number of times all edges need to be relaxed is n-1 where n is the number of nodes.
	
	proof:
		relaxation starts from src
		
		the longest path that can be from src to any node (no cycles included) can be of n-1 edges.

		and every time atleast on of the edge in this path would get updated (if needed)

		so max n - 1 iterations of the relaxation process are required


algo:

for n-1 times:
	any_edge_updated = False
	for all edges:
		if dist[edge.dest] > edge.wt + dist[edge.src]:
			dist[edge.dest] = edge.wt + dist[edge.src]
			any_edge_updated = True
	if not any_edge_updated:
		break

// note that the above code will not update anything if dist[edge.src] is infinity

code :

adj = [[None, 5, 2, None, None],
       [None, None, 1, None, None],
       [None, None, None, -1, -1],
       [None, None, None, None, None],
       [3, None, None, 2, None]]

inf = 999999999999999
n = len(adj)
src = 0
dist = [inf] * n
dist[src] = 0

for _ in range(n - 1):
    any_edge_updated = False
    for nodefrom in range(n):
        for nodeto in range(n):
            if adj[nodefrom][nodeto] and dist[nodefrom] != inf and dist[nodeto] > adj[nodefrom][nodeto] + dist[nodefrom]:
                dist[nodeto] = adj[nodefrom][nodeto] + dist[nodefrom]
                any_edge_updated = True
        if not any_edge_updated:
            break

print(dist)

output:
[0, 5, 2, 1, 1]


time complexity:
	e*v

	if v is n and we know e is at max v*v-1

	=> O(n^3)
